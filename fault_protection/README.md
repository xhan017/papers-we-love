> As software becomes more and more integrated in our daily lives, we
> need, more than ever, for the software we write to work reliably in a
> wide range of conditions--even, and especially, in unexpected
> conditions. This paper, written by Robert Rasmussen from the Jet
> Propulsion Laboratory in 2008, documents and explains some fundamental
> principles about designing fault tolerant systems as learned through
> the hard-won experience of designing Guidance, Navigation, and Control
> (GN&C) systems for spacecraft. This paper is rich in principles,
> examples, and advice, and has a lot to offer to our industry
> generally--even for those of us who don't actively work on software for
> spaceships!
